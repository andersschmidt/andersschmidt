As medcial doctors, we rely on making fast and good descisions about patient care. 



The descision tree can be created and explored through the *FFTrees* package (available on CRAN) created by Dr. Nathaniel D. Philips. The package was demonstrated at a UseR! 2017 ([presentation](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/FFTrees-An-R-package-to-create-visualise-and-use-fast-and-frugal-decision-trees).
