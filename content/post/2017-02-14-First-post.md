First, welcome to my personal website! I have created this site to share with you:

* My recent research projects and ongoing activities
* Blog posts on buring research topics to share my view - feel free to comment!
* Valurable links and ressources for conducting research

In this first blog post I would like to comment on the **value** of creating a fully personal website for sharing your research.

Many researchers have their own profile on the local university site, on researchgate, LinkedIn or somvhere else. Being part of a community
is important, of cause, but the flexibility and costomizations for sharing knowledge is often very limited. Interestingly, creating your own website enables fully control on the way you express yourself.

Common barriers for setting up such a site may be:

* Lack of experience - no coding abilities or knowledge on how to setup a website
* Costs  - where to hosts the site?
* Time - good are intentions, but it can be hard to set aside some time for maintaining the website

However, using blogdown within R Studio, hosting at Github and deploying the site through netlify.com is extremely easy - and free!
